### 1. Overview
The **Bache Talks Librarian** Custom GPT provides semantic access to the *Christopher M. Bache Public Talks Archive (2014–2025)* using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API hosted at **https://bache-rag-api.onrender.com**.

This system is an educational and archival resource designed to support open research into consciousness studies and the philosophy of Christopher M. Bache.

---

### 2. Data Handling
- **User inputs** (queries) are processed by OpenAI for generating responses.  
- The GPT’s **external action** connects to the Bache RAG API, which receives only text queries.  
- The API **does not store, log, or share** user queries, IP addresses, or identifiers.  
- The system uses **no cookies, analytics, or tracking** of any kind.  

---

### 3. Data Retention
The RAG API is **stateless**. No query or metadata is persisted beyond the duration of the request. All processing happens in memory and is discarded once the response is returned.

---

### 4. Third-Party Services
This GPT relies on:
- **OpenAI** — to process natural-language prompts and responses.  
- **Render.com** — to host the Bache RAG API.  

No additional third-party data sharing occurs.

### 5. Your Rights
As no personal data is collected or stored, there are no retained records to access, modify, or delete.  
Questions or concerns can be directed to [bache-archive@tuta.com](mailto:bache-archive@tuta.com).
