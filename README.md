# Bache Talks RAG API

**Semantic Retrieval API for the Chris Bache Archive (2014 ‚Äì 2025)**  
FastAPI backend providing citation-grounded semantic search across the verified public-talk corpus of philosopher-mystic **Christopher M. Bache**.  
Implements `/search` and `/answer` endpoints used by the Custom GPT *Bache Talks Librarian*.

---

## üìñ Overview

This service transforms the [**Chris Bache Archive**](https://github.com/bache-archive/chris-bache-archive) from a static collection of transcripts into an interactive research engine.

Each talk transcript (‚âà1 M characters total) is pre-segmented into ~2,800 overlapping paragraph chunks, embedded using **OpenAI text-embedding-3-large**, and indexed with **FAISS** for high-speed cosine search.  

The API returns fully citable excerpts with stable metadata:

(talk_id, archival_title, recorded_date, chunk_index, sha256)

and supports grounded summaries for scholarly and spiritual study.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Endpoints

| Route | Method | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `/search` | `POST` | Semantic nearest-neighbor search. Returns top-k transcript chunks matching a natural-language query. |
| `/answer` | `POST` | Synthesizes a concise, citation-grounded summary from selected chunk IDs. |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST https://bache-rag-api.onrender.com/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Diamond Luminosity","top_k":3}'
