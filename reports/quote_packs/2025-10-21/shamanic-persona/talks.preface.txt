Based on the archived talks, here are the most relevant passages: ity, but generally, the better run the session, the more coherent the shamanic persona that emerges.
When one begins to open to deeper levels of transpersonal reality, our earlier psychedelic history must yield to the new territory. Our previous psychedelic knowledge and the identity based on it must surrender control before a deeper mode of knowing can emerge and stabilize. What’s dying in these sessions, then, is sometimes the shamanic persona; its death may feel personal, but it’s not the… (2015-03-16, Exploring the Boundaries of Death and Rebirth in LSD Psychotherapy) n help illuminate how our psyche manages the extreme fluctuations that occur in psychedelic therapy.
Specifically, I want to suggest that, through repeatedly opening and closing awareness in psychedelic sessions, a semi-autonomous, state-specific consciousness is formed, retaining and integrating the knowledge and capacities developed. I call this the shamanic persona—a psychedelically generated, state-specific alter ego.

Chris Bache
Yes. When I started, I thought there was just one death—ego death—that would launch you into the spiritual universe. But the spiritual universe has many layers. Being operational at one layer doesn’t mean you’re operational at deeper layers. You go through another metamorphosis—another death and surrender—to be reborn into another layer, and so on. That reflects the Tibetan idea of… (2021-03-16, Contemplating Reincarnation – Part 2) later. Can you take us further into your sessions to give us a taste of what that was like for you?
Chris Bache: That’s hard because of context. Some very influential books were based on a limited number of psychedelic experiences. Aldous Huxley wrote The Doors of Perception after one mescaline experience. Huston Smith wrote his reflections after taking LSD six times. Michael Pollan’s helpful book was also after a handful of experiences. The challenge with my work is how long the journey was… (2025-03-18, Psychedelics and the Cosmic Mind)
