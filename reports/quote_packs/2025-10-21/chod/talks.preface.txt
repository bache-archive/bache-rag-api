Based on the archived talks, here are the most relevant passages: never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.
Working at very high energetic levels sometimes set in motion processes difficult to integrate in my subtle energy system. If you know Alex Grey’s depictions of powerful energies triggered in deep psychedelic work, you’ll recognize how, after a session, your system can feel achy and stretched.

What do you think it was about Vajrayana Buddhism that attracted you and felt like a home?
Chris Bache:
It was my first wife, Carol—my sitter in my sessions and a clinical psychologist—who really brought me into Vajrayana. I was more interested in the Zen tradition.
