Based on the archived talks, here are the most relevant passages: ork.

Lauren Taus: You took 73 high-dose LSD trips over the course of 20 years—and really high dose?
Chris Bache: Yeah. And I wouldn't recommend that. I wouldn't do it the same way again myself, and I strongly recommend that people don't do it that way. I would be much gentler with myself and have a more modulated approach. But that's what I did. I started with three sessions at medium doses—about 250 micrograms—and then for the remainder I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms.

Lauren Taus: What… (2023-06-30, Learning to be Gods: Conversations about LSD and the Mind of the Universe with Chris Bache, [00:06:28–00:06:51](https://www.inbodiedlife.com/blog/chris-bache)) th psilocybin and ayahuasca. I still would have taken the journey, but not as aggressively as I did.
Sandy Sedgbeer: You experienced 73 higher-dose LSD sessions following protocols established by Stanislav Grof, with the intention of engaging hyper-intensive states in a way that would allow the initial chaos at each new level to clear and also allow your biophysical and psychological systems to adapt. How did you know the precise dosage to accomplish that in the way you wanted to?

Chris Bache:… (2023-08-17, LSD & the Mind of the Universe (What Is Going OM), [00:04:47–00:05:15](https://youtu.be/2Trb-vC8zc0?t=286)) ending that people engage in the same process you did or advocating their use per se. Is that right?
Chris Bache: Absolutely. A large percentage of the population shouldn’t be doing psychedelics at all. These are very powerful amplifiers of consciousness with tremendous evocative potential. No one should venture into these waters without really good, high-quality professional guides to keep you safe. My protocol was high doses of LSD—500 to 600 micrograms. Looking back, I think, what was I… (2025-03-18, Psychedelics and the Cosmic Mind, [00:07:09–00:07:36](https://youtu.be/FMgixG6Z0sk?t=429)) ople asked about those levels. And, as you said, you would go lower if you were to do it over again.
Chris Bache:
After the first three sessions, which were medium-dose, I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms—right at the body’s maximum capacity to absorb. Taking more doesn’t necessarily take you deeper. I was working at very high levels that can shatter the structures of consciousness and take you temporarily beyond your traditional ways of knowing yourself and the world. Again, I would be much… (2025-05-18, Diamond Luminosity (live stream), [00:24:42–00:25:09](https://youtu.be/FlHqinHyt9I?t=1481)) ally that model shattered when I realized the sessions went far beyond my personal psyche and karma.
Jef Baker:
Was that at the point of the “ocean of suffering,” when you experienced the collective human pain throughout history? That was honestly hard to read.

Chris Bache:
Yes. I had to think carefully about how much to expose, because it’s challenging material. But to finish that earlier point, even after I let go of the personal model, I found I liked where the high-dose work took me. It… (2020-04-19, Bicycle Day Conversation with Jef Baker)
