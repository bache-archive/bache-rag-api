My life has been deeply influenced by all the spiritual traditions of the world—I taught world religions for years, and I consider them all dear friends—but the two that have influenced me most deeply are Christianity and Buddhism. I think you’re absolutely right: what we’re looking at is heaven on Earth. That is the vision moving forward—an embodiment of heavenly states of consciousness in our physical existence.”

I forgot to mention: my wife, Christina, is a professional astrologer. Working with astrology and psychedelic sessions yields really interesting insights, and she helped me understand some of the archetypal dynamics in the material.”

Chris Bache: If we just look around us, it’s a web of cause and effect. We live in a continuous web: the air we breathe, the weather patterns, our biology, what we ate, the purity of what we ate, the movement of the planets. Here we’re focusing on that portion of the web that influences the development of the soul—our human psychophysical development—which is a subset of this larger cause-and-effect fabric.”

Richard Rudd Particularly as we start to understand the universe a little more—the parameters of the universe—as we look out. I know you’ve got some wonderful slides you want to share, which would be a great backdrop if you want to show them.  Chris Bache When I think about where reincarnation is taking us—the larger scope and purpose of rebirth—I turn to the pictures NASA sends around every day. I collect and meditate on them, try to envision the enormous distances and the millions and billions of stars, and the life burgeoning on so many planets and systems. The sheer fertility—the profligate fertility—of the universe, and the scale at which the universe is thinking to create and manifest orders upon orders of evolving life on this magnitude. And then to appreciate that we are part of this.”

Now that we better grasp how huge the universe is and how long it’s been around, if you want to understand life you have to begin to think like God—like a galaxy. The creative intelligence thinks in terms of billions of years, of species and planetary systems and galactic systems. We have to expand to understand our role in such a universe, and reincarnation allows us to do that. It helps us understand tensions woven into our body and mind and invites us to participate more fully in the divine project.”

# Exploring the Boundaries of Death and Rebirth in LSD Psychotherapy
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/cEsoN2IaGc4) — “smology—which resonates deeply with the psychedelic cosmology Stan has described in The Cosmic Game. Aurobindo’s vision is of a cascading involution of the Divine, generating multiple levels of reality—all divine, but within those levels, a descending scale of self-awareness of divinity, like a series of one-way mirrors: the divine looking down sees all; the divine looking up sees less. At the end of Dark Night, Early Dawn, I noted that, in a multilevel cosmology, a death-rebirth event can function as both liberation from below to above, and infusion from above to below. At the threshold, one can feel energy moving in both directions—death-rebirth as ascent and descent.”

If we really want to go deep into this collective transformation, it’s a good time to step back into a larger context—into the presence of the creative intelligence of the universe, the divine intelligence, the great power. The starlights behind me are not just stars. Some are stars, but many are galaxies with billions and billions of stars—an unimaginable outpouring of power and genius. It’s the same genius that birthed this universe, that is birthing this time in history, and that has placed us here to participate consciously in this milestone century. We will come out of this century profoundly different than we came into it.”

I then stopped my work for six years for reasons I describe in the book. When I resumed, the ocean of suffering started exactly where it had stopped and continued to build in intensity over the remaining year—seven more sessions in a different time of my life with different expectations and under different astrological transits. The ocean began exactly where it had stopped, which I think reflects the depth and power of the intelligence and consciousness directing these episodes—certainly not my intelligence, something larger than me.”

* [01:12:16](https://youtu.be/uHn8lzYNXyE?t=4335) — “se I was working in a collective context and could see these ripples coming back at me all the time. On the issue of astrology and individual and global transits, this is a complicated question, and I'm not an astrologer, so I want to be careful. I tracked my sessions. I used astrology to plan my sessions after I learned from Rick Tarnas about correlations between outer planets and inner experience in psychedelic states. I planned my sessions by transits, and I tracked the patterns of my breakthroughs against the planets. I found a very complicated correlation. While there were correlations between my individual transits and global transits with the unfolding of my psychedelic experience, there were also differences I wasn't expecting—a failure to find correspondence. For example, my breakthroughs were not always paired with Uranus. My really intense, up-against-the-wall, death-in-your-face experiences were not marked by Saturn transits or Saturn global transits, or even Pluto transits.”
* [01:14:01](https://youtu.be/uHn8lzYNXyE?t=4440) — “work. Whether those correlations continue to be as strong in the later stages, I'm not as convinced. In terms of my own chart, that gets complicated. I have a lot of Neptune and a lot of water in my chart. I have a Sun square Neptune with Neptune in the first house, and other dynamics. I was destined to do this type of work. I also want to mention the ocean of suffering. This was not something forced on me. I didn't understand it at the time, and I don't think the universe forces any of us into this type of work. It was too hard, too demanding, too difficult to have been forced on me. What I learned over time is that this is something I voluntarily took on in this incarnation. It was part of the plan of my incarnation to do this work, and to do the ocean of suffering work in particular. I'm a volunteer, and I think when we get into this deep muck, we're volunteers for this work.”

Chris Bache: Good question, and a complicated one. Rick Tarnas is a good friend, as is Stan, and I'm aware of Stan's writing and his analysis of cases and the astrological correlations of people going through breakthroughs. I'm aware of the proposal that the outer planets correlating with the perinatal matrices seem to be somewhat predictive of patterns of oppression, contraction, breakthrough, and liberation in people's experiences.  I've looked at these correlations in my own work. First of all, I completely accept the proposal they've made. I understand it. It makes sense. The intelligence of the universe that I experience makes it intuitive that the rhythm of the universe would be part of the rhythm of this intelligence, and that as we open beyond the personal psyche there would be a kind of solar system pulse in the nature of our experiences.”
* [01:12:36](https://youtu.be/icBasHgjzsY?t=4356) — “nd the personal psyche there would be a kind of solar system pulse in the nature of our experiences. That said, I have not found the correlations to be as striking as I expected. As my work deepened over the years, I couldn't correlate breakthroughs and impasses with astrological variables as much as I had anticipated. That led me to formulate what I call the roll off hypothesis: in the early stages of our work, or at lower doses—when our time-space identity is being unfolded and impacted—I think there are stronger correlations between our natal transits, the transits to our natal chart, or even global transits. But as one’s work deepens, when you begin to go into and beyond archetypal reality—beyond time and space and deep into the universe—I think there's a roll off effect of the planetary correlates to experience.”

# LSD and the Mind of the Universe – Interview with Stephen Gray
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/zXt-LkmINyc) — “ty from the ego of this short-term body to the soul, which lives and feels on a much larger horizon. This birth of soul consciousness inside time is happening as the planet tries to come to terms with its divisive history and confronts problems that can’t be solved at the national level, only the global. As we try to come together as one planet, internally the players are trying to come together as one soul. There’s reciprocity between the outer political-ecological dynamic and the inner psycho-spiritual one. The ego built this world, but the ego will never be able to solve the problems we’ve generated. It takes the expansion of the soul—the depth of courage, compassion, and insight—to carry us into the next stage of our planetary evolution.”

On the positive side, once I went through the ocean in that next year, I entered a domain of consciousness that took me beyond anything to do with personal reality—into the mind of the universe. In the section I call initiation into the universe, at a different time of life and with different astrological transits, I was given a series of carefully orchestrated teachings—initiations into the cosmic order of things. I always give sessions names as mnemonic devices; I write them down in bullet points and name them to remember the journey all at once. The names in that chapter—initiation into the universe—give you the flavor of how profoundly transpersonal these experiences were. It was a deep excursion in cosmology 101: how the universe works at a fundamental level.”

The therapist’s story—healing the personal psyche—is vitally important work; it’s just not the story I’m telling. I’m telling the story of a love affair with the universe and with the intelligence of the universe. My name for this intelligence is “my Beloved,” because engaging it activates such profound love in your being. It’s the most intimate kind of true becoming-one to a preexisting One. I wish it were not a love affair but an abiding marriage—maybe one day it will be. But these are temporary states, not permanent ones. You have to come to terms with that temporariness. It’s very much like an affair: you enter, make love in some way, then come back and try to live it as best you can inside time and space.”
* [—:—:—](https://www.inbodiedlife.com/blog/chris-bache) — “he universe, allowing a more intimate rapport to develop, a rapport that has immediate consequences. Since all the intelligence, all the answers we could ever want, already exist inside the divine mind—divine reality—I use “divine” not in a theistic, culturally narrow sense, but in a post-religious, broader horizon, on the scale science has shown us: a universe billions of years old, a creative project billions of years in the making, a framework that dwarfs all the religions of history. This process is taking us into a new and unprecedented opportunity. And so this is a hard time—the time of birth. Gestation is long; labor is fast. We have been gestating the future human for thousands of years through our evolutionary reincarnation dynamic. But the time of giving birth to this new human is now. It’s short, intense, hard, painful—and magnificent. The project is coming into fruition. It’s hard to let go of our habits of the past, but it’s a time of grace.”

Chris Bache: The movements you mentioned—neo-paganism and eco-spirituality—I see both as attempting to put nature back into spiritual discourse, which was one of the things lost in the classic patriarchal religions. They’re trying to bring us back to the innate wisdom of nature, a wisdom that runs throughout our consciousness and our bodies, connecting our body consciousness to the body consciousness of Earth. Eco-spirituality is a way of experiencing spirituality that connects us to the planet and to the stars.  We can see this in the resurgence of interest in astrology—not a naive, mechanistic astrology, but the vision that the universe has a pulse to it. The galaxies have a pulse, our solar system has a pulse, and if you know how to read that pulse, you can feel how your body and destiny unfold in rhythm with it. That’s a form of eco-spirituality—solar spirituality, galactic spirituality.”

If Christology is the study of the Christ archetype, for me that archetype is bigger than Jesus. It’s a larger dynamic of profound awakening of the human heart, mind, and spirit. I live and breathe in Universalist waters: recognizing the distinctness of each lineage and the overlapping common ground.”

# Scientific Evidence for Reincarnation
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/x_iGTmrzIpY) — “t to researchers across great distances; it often happens inside families, so it deserves attention. Michael Newton wrote two wonderful books. If you read only one or two from this list, I hope you’ll read Newton. A hypnotherapist doing past-life therapy, he accidentally discovered that clients in deep hypnosis could remember not only previous lives but what happened after they died. He followed them—good therapist that he is—through death into the afterlife memories and asked careful questions, keeping detailed notes. Regardless of background—fundamentalist Baptist, Karl Marxist atheist, hard-core scientific reductionist—people described the same fundamental reality in the after-death state: a world with order, structure, and logic; a social structure where older learners teach younger learners; and a place where reincarnation is a conscious, careful choice. It’s like choosing college courses: once you sign up, you’re committed for the semester. Incarnating is an important choice made under the guidance of spiritual helpers and in cooperation with the people you’ll incarnate with. Before we were born—when we knew more than we know now—we chose the life we’re living. That fact alone bears deep meditation.”

* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/I1n2E46S-4E) — “wisdom, intelligence, compassion. Do you apply any frameworks from your studies to understand this? Chris Bache In addition to what you mention, we have Hopi prophecies and others from indigenous cultures that have long spoken of profound transformation. It does line up. The general perception is that we are in a period of darkness, but I’d conceptualize that darkness as the conditioning of the past—the karmic patterns shaping the human psyche at deep structural levels—being driven to the surface. We are entering a period of infusion of grace and energy that’s driving the past up so we can deal with it: the hatreds of history, the divisions of race, gender, nationality, haves and have-nots—all the patterns of splitting the world into categories—are being driven out of us. They have to come out to make us available to the influx of divine energy entering us, whether you think of it as coming from above or from within. There’s something deeply true in these ancient prophecies: we are, in a sense, in the age of the Kali Yuga and coming into a profound new age. When and how we get there, I don't know, but there’s a relationship.”
