Thank you. We have questions in the chat. David, do you want to address some of them?

That was a beautiful answer, Chris—so well said. John Hock has a question. David, while you look, why don’t we let John ask his question? Go ahead, John.

A couple quick ones—well, the first may not be quick. I asked Stan Grof at one point if there was anything he could correlate a difficult trip with. He said his work with Tarnas and his own work turned up that a hard… (2021-06-03, LSD and the Mind of the Universe – Christopher Bache, Ph.D.) se I was working in a collective context and could see these ripples coming back at me all the time.
On the issue of astrology and individual and global transits, this is a complicated question, and I'm not an astrologer, so I want to be careful. I tracked my sessions. I used astrology to plan my sessions after I learned from Rick Tarnas about correlations between outer planets and inner experience in psychedelic states. I planned my sessions by transits, and I tracked the patterns of my… (2019-11-13, LSD & the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven, [01:12:16–01:12:42](https://youtu.be/uHn8lzYNXyE?t=4335)) ce experiences were not marked by Saturn transits or Saturn global transits, or even Pluto transits.
When my work began to go off the edge of time and space—when I began to enter deeper and deeper into archetypal reality, and then beyond archetypal reality into Dharmakaya or the Diamond Luminosity—I felt a roll-off of astrological variables. My psychedelic dance did not map easily into the astrological dance. I began to think there might be a roll-off effect between one's solar dance and one's… (2019-11-13, LSD & the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven) ooking at astrological variables, exploring correlations that Stan and Richard Tarnas have proposed.
A few more introductory comments. The story I tell in LSD and the Mind of the Universe is not primarily a personal story; it’s primarily a cosmological story. I found it useful to picture a series of sine waves representing sessions, overlapping to emphasize the continuity that runs between them. Insights into my personal life tended to arise at the beginnings and endings of sessions—when I was… (2021-06-03, LSD and the Mind of the Universe – Christopher Bache, Ph.D.) bsequent personal experiences, including a past-life regression in my 20s, I’m in the believer camp.
Chris, who spoke here a couple of years ago, was wonderful, and many of you have read his books and appreciated the work he’s done. Chris is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He’s also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an Emeritus Fellow at the Institute of Noetic… (2024-11-16, The Evidence for Reincarnation, [00:01:06–00:01:32](https://youtu.be/iCKq7-de8Xg?t=66))
