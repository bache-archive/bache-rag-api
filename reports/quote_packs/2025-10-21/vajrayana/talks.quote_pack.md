# A Visionary Experience of the Birth of the Future Human
* [01:00:58](https://youtu.be/-xbx5HnOFmA?t=3658) — “e vision moving forward—an embodiment of heavenly states of consciousness in our physical existence. Stepping back, all the religions of the last 5,000 years have been what I would call “up-and-out” cosmologies: you achieve salvation or awakening, and once you achieve that state, you leave. The Hindu word for enlightenment was moksha—escape—escaping time and space. I think those cosmologies got half the message, but lost half the message. They represent incomplete visions of history because they leave unanswered the question: What is the purpose of time and space? What is the purpose of this magnificent universe? It’s been called a veil of suffering, a place to get out of as quickly as we can to return to divine bliss. I understand that, given the historical period when we began to have experiential access to deep divine truths. Naturally we would feel drawn to being there, and if we could not realize those truths here, we would want to be there.”

# Bicycle Day Conversation with Jef Baker
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/B0BhUOEP1Mg) — “ime, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings? Chris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.”

Chris Bache: In my experience, working at high doses, every session breaks down into two phases: a purification phase and an ecstatic phase. There’s the dark, hard, death-and-dying kind of phase, and then the ecstatic phase. In reference to this work, James’ excellent talk this morning about shadow work was on point. Working as I did in a non-therapeutic modality, one of the great gifts I learned from Stan Grof is to completely, absolutely surrender to whatever is taking place in your sessions and let it take you as far as it wants to take you.”

# Diamond Luminosity (live stream)
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/FlHqinHyt9I) — “ferently, where causal-level reality is a different physics, a different landscape of consciousness. When you open to these depths and then return to ordinary consciousness, it’s really important to have a daily practice to anchor you, to keep your feet on the ground. The skills cultivated in Vipassana or zazen—observation and non-attachment—are precisely the skills you use in a psychedelic session, so they reinforce each other. Meditation also gives you an environment to assess the cognitive content of your sessions and to process the energy ignited in them.  In the chapter on Diamond Luminosity, I talk about integrating Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice. I didn’t begin Vajrayana until about the time I was entering Diamond Luminosity. Carol brought me into the Vajrayana tradition by doing a ChÃ¶d practice for me before one of my sessions. The window that opened—this was my 45th session, so I had a lot of history—was wider, deeper, and stayed open longer than earlier sessions. I immediately learned that practice and began doing it before any session. I would never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.”
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/FlHqinHyt9I) — “never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice. Working at very high energetic levels sometimes set in motion processes difficult to integrate in my subtle energy system. If you know Alex Grey’s depictions of powerful energies triggered in deep psychedelic work, you’ll recognize how, after a session, your system can feel achy and stretched. Vajrayana practices—Guru Yoga or deity yoga—gave that energy a place to run when I was back in ordinary consciousness and body. So for clarifying cognitive content, practicing teachings given in sessions, and managing the energetic consequences, a daily spiritual practice is really important.”

Over five years and 26 sessions, I was taken into this reality only four times. In between, there was tremendous purification. In these states, you dissolve into light, take on the qualities and boundlessness of light—you dissolve in the crystalline nature of the Divine. I don’t mean divine in any conventional or theistic sense, but I have no other vocabulary for it. In each of those four adventures going deeper, the divine began to come deeper into my body. I was handled carefully and broken down, and then this consciousness brought me to the end of my work, gave me an overview of all my sessions, showed me the whole pattern, and gave me my final instructions. I didn’t know it was over until it called it. I knew then I had to stop.”

# Diamonds from Heaven – Lecture at TimeWaver Summer World 2018
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/O4ui6I1Wo9c) — “undation. I believe we are on the threshold of becoming a species of Buddhas, Christs, and prophets. After the benediction of blessings, I felt completely fulfilled. The universe had asked something of me, and in offering it up, I was rewarded with more joy than I could have ever imagined—a philosopher’s dream come true. I had known God, the fertile void, and profound joy. Little did I know I still had five years to go in this journey. After one more cycle of death and rebirth, I entered an extraordinarily clear state of consciousness—which I came to call diamond luminosity. This is what Buddhists refer to as Dharmakaya, the absolute clear light of being. Though I had encountered light in many subtle dimensions before, diamond light is of a different order entirely—ultra-clear, super-luminous, beyond imagination.”
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/O4ui6I1Wo9c) — “to the primal void, the Buddha womb, Satchitananda, the fertile void beneath all manifest existence. Another session, which I titled "Jesus' Blood," was an overwhelming experience of cosmic love. It's being drenched in a love so deep you realize you've never truly been loved until you've been loved like God loves—a force far deeper than anything I had encountered before. Another pivotal experience was the "birth of the diamond soul." Eleven years prior, I had an experience of my life as a completed whole, from start to finish, but in my fortieth session, I began to sense the integration of all my former lives. It was as if all my previous incarnations were winding together, like a string of white light around a kite spool. When this collective memory hit a critical mass, it exploded, fusing all those individual lives into one, and my consciousness soared beyond any sense of individual existence. I experienced what I call diamond luminosity—my heart ruptured, and my awareness expanded dramatically. This was my first taste of the state where I believe reincarnation is taking us.”

I was given teachings reframing the goal of reincarnation. Much inherited teaching arose in cultures where the pattern was: we’re mired in illusion, we grow slowly through incarnations, eventually awaken to our divine nature, and then leave time and space—moksha, escape. Many cosmologies of the last few millennia are “up and out”: salvation, realization, and departure to an off-planet paradise. I think that’s incomplete—representing a developmental stage, not the end.”

Even as you recount it now, I can see you going into your experience, deeply touched decades later. It’s an exquisite example of how these experiences continue to incarnate in and as you. And you emphasized again that awakenings aren’t the end point; beyond them is integration—allowing the realization to incarnate through us. You pointed to diamond vision and its resonance with Tibetan Buddhism. Interestingly, Tibetan Buddhism speaks of a further stage—pure perception—where one’s perception is transformed so that this world is seen not as mundane materiality but as an expression of that diamond illumination, a pure land optimized for awakening. Your description of both the illumination and its effects mirrors what’s recognized and highly valued in certain traditions.”

# Exploring LSD as a Practice (Edge of Mind Podcast – Part 1)
* [01:58:42](https://youtu.be/eV86_iSTEbU?t=7122) — “meditation and Vajrayana in augmenting, supporting, enhancing, stabilizing what you’ve gone through? Chris Bache One gift of my psychedelic experiences was a deepened appreciation for the power and effectiveness of classic contemplative practices, including Vajrayana. By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality. Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence. It taught me these practices are much more powerful than I’d appreciated working from ordinary time-space consciousness.”

Andrew Holecek This resonates deeply—acknowledging the hubris of saying “my path betokens the truth, therefore yours is true because it relates to mine.” But with that caveat, there are many resonances, especially the notion of purification. As we start to close for today, one section that really spoke to me was your interjection of the Vajrayana path, and how it might create a holding environment to support, augment, and transition—more organic, phenomenological means versus purely neurological ones. For people listening who want something to take home: what has been, and continues to be, the role of meditation and Vajrayana in augmenting, supporting, enhancing, stabilizing what you’ve gone through?”

Let me quickly list the chapters: there’s a methodology chapter, and then, in terms of content, Crossing the Boundary of Birth and Death; The Ocean of Suffering; Deep Time and the Soul; Initiation into the Universe; The Greater Real of Archetypal Reality; A Benediction of Blessings; The Birth of the Future Human; Diamond Luminosity and Final Vision; and the last chapter, Coming Off the Mountain. It took me a year to write that last chapter, reflecting on what has been happening in my life in the 20 years after I stopped my psychedelic work. I’ll touch a few points in each chapter and then open it up for questions.”

* [00:54:17](https://youtu.be/Kh5aqAuDBIM?t=3256) — “essions I was given many practices—told, “Do this, do that”—and I took those into my daily practice. In the last five years of my work, as I discuss in the Diamond Luminosity chapter, I entered Vajrayana Buddhism. I’d always been a meditator, but I began a more formal relationship with Vajrayana teachers and practice. This helped where I was working—very pure, intense states of awareness, Diamond Luminosity. It was increasingly difficult for my subtle energy system to sustain encounters with the enormous flows of pure energy in this diamond consciousness. When I began doing ancient practices—ChÃ¶d and various deity practices—I found my physical, psychological, and subtle energy systems could breathe more freely. Vajrayana gave me a space midway between physical consciousness and psychedelic consciousness. By entering those states, I could channel the energy that came in my psychedelic sessions; it moved more freely. It gave me a way of dialoguing with the universe that allowed my body and mind to breathe more comfortably. It was very helpful.”

I was 15 years into my journey, blessed beyond imagining, asked to give something in the ocean of suffering work, and rewarded with more blessings than I could count. Still, five years remained. I went through yet another death-and-rebirth and entered what I call the domain of diamond luminosity—a reality exceptionally clear. It was light, but a particular quality. I’d known light many times—people often experience great light at ego death—but the diamond light isn’t a metaphor. It’s a particular quality: exceptionally pure, so clear it takes your breath away. I think Buddhism calls this Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.  Over the next four years and 26 sessions—about a third of all my sessions—I only entered this reality four times. In between, more purification, more teaching, more absorbing lessons. The first two sessions took me deeper into diamond luminosity; then there was a pivot. In the last two, the diamond luminosity was crunching itself deeper into my mind, personality, physiology, biochemistry.”

Let me back up: light entered my experiences in many forms and levels—many gradations. I'd experienced light many times in earlier death-rebirth processes. When I talk about the diamond light, it isn't just a metaphor: I'm describing an exceptionally clear and intense awareness, a crystalline light that eventually becomes transparent to itself. In those last five years—the last 26 sessions, about a third of all my work—I entered that reality four times, about once a year. Each time involved more detoxification, and about a year later, I'd re-enter that reality. That’s the kind of larger overview.”

# Part II of his Remarkable Twenty-Year Journey into the World of Psychedelics (Edge of Mind Podcast – Part 2)
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/-vebDk9FRYU) — “u’ve used Dharmakaya. Are there other Tibetan or Buddhist terms that relate to what you experienced? Chris Bache: Yes. Clear light mind, to me, is closer to the nature of mind in this context. I’m still digesting the differences between Diamond Luminosity as an extra-samsaric reality and Diamond Luminosity as the foundation of nirmanakaya existence. There are many correlations, and all honor to the great beings who have explored these dimensions more deeply than I’ve been able to—always a humble student of the great teachers. I put names as best I can to clarify, but it’s tricky—naming can shrink-wrap and stop the mystery, letting the mind back in where it doesn’t belong. So let me step into a little different framework.”
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/-vebDk9FRYU) — “fferent names. We can feel it in our bones: Maitreya, that higher realization working its way to us. Andrew Holecek: That’s exquisite. And I wonder if “growing down” might be a more appropriate embodied aspect—because “growing up” can sound like moksha, escapist, FedEx my consciousness to a pure land. It’s really waking down into the majesty—integrating your work, metabolizing, digesting, incorporating—literally bringing into soma this vast realization.”

* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/FEQ8ony19sk) — “developed forms of Vajrayana practice by integrating those memories into the realization protocols. For example, in classic Vajrayana we distinguish between the Samaya Safa and the Jnana sattva. The Samaya Sava is the being of construct we formulate through mantras, visualizations, tankas—an approximation of pure goodness and pure insight—which then attracts the Jnana reality, the cosmic reality. We make our visualization pure to open a channel so the cosmic reality can pour its blessings into us. In a way, I use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my Samaya Safa. The living memory of the diamond luminosity is, for me, a more effective spiritual vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way.”
* [—:—:—](https://youtu.be/FEQ8ony19sk) — “vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way. I also have a sense—because I’ve “died” so many times and gone where I will go when I die physically—that I feel very comfortable with that domain. We’re told over and over that we practice to prepare for the moment of death because it has great potential for accelerating our evolution. I agree. My psychedelic practice has been done in a way to prepare me for the moment of death. The result is that I feel comfortable with death and with navigating what comes after, because I feel I’ve already encountered it in many ways.  Tasshin Fogleman: What do you think it was about Vajrayana Buddhism that attracted you and felt like a home?”
