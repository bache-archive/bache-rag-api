      "text": "developed forms of Vajrayana practice by integrating those memories into the realization protocols.\nFor example, in classic Vajrayana we distinguish between the Samaya Safa and the Jnana sattva. The Samaya Sava is the being of construct we formulate through mantras, visualizations, tankas—an approximation of pure goodness and pure insight—which then attracts the Jnana reality, the cosmic reality. We make our visualization pure to open a channel so the cosmic reality can pour its blessings into us. In a way, I use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my Samaya Safa. The living memory of the diamond luminosity is, for me, a more effective spiritual vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way.",

I’d always been a meditator, but I began a more formal relationship with Vajrayana teachers and practice. This helped where I was working—very pure, intense states of awareness, Diamond Luminosity. It was increasingly difficult for my subtle energy system to sustain encounters with the enormous flows of pure energy in this diamond consciousness. When I began doing ancient practices—ChÃ¶d and various deity practices—I found my physical, psychological, and subtle energy systems could breathe more freely. Vajrayana gave me a space midway between physical consciousness and psychedelic consciousness. By entering those states, I could channel the energy that came in my psychedelic sessions; it moved more freely. It gave me a way of dialoguing with the universe that allowed my body and mind to breathe more comfortably. It was very helpful.",

By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality. Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence. It taught me these practices are much more powerful than I’d appreciated working from ordinary time-space consciousness.",

The skills cultivated in Vipassana or zazen—observation and non-attachment—are precisely the skills you use in a psychedelic session, so they reinforce each other. Meditation also gives you an environment to assess the cognitive content of your sessions and to process the energy ignited in them.\n\nIn the chapter on Diamond Luminosity, I talk about integrating Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice. I didn’t begin Vajrayana until about the time I was entering Diamond Luminosity. Carol brought me into the Vajrayana tradition by doing a ChÃ¶d practice for me before one of my sessions. The window that opened—this was my 45th session, so I had a lot of history—was wider, deeper, and stayed open longer than earlier sessions. I immediately learned that practice and began doing it before any session. I would never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.",

      "text": "ime, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings?\nChris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.",

I'd experienced light many times in earlier death-rebirth processes. When I talk about the diamond light, it isn't just a metaphor: I'm describing an exceptionally clear and intense awareness, a crystalline light that eventually becomes transparent to itself. In those last five years—the last 26 sessions, about a third of all my work—I entered that reality four times, about once a year. Each time involved more detoxification, and about a year later, I'd re-enter that reality. That’s the kind of larger overview.",

Still, five years remained. I went through yet another death-and-rebirth and entered what I call the domain of diamond luminosity—a reality exceptionally clear. It was light, but a particular quality. I’d known light many times—people often experience great light at ego death—but the diamond light isn’t a metaphor. It’s a particular quality: exceptionally pure, so clear it takes your breath away. I think Buddhism calls this Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.\n\nOver the next four years and 26 sessions—about a third of all my sessions—I only entered this reality four times. In between, more purification, more teaching, more absorbing lessons. The first two sessions took me deeper into diamond luminosity; then there was a pivot. In the last two, the diamond luminosity was crunching itself deeper into my mind, personality, physiology, biochemistry.",

It's being drenched in a love so deep you realize you've never truly been loved until you've been loved like God loves—a force far deeper than anything I had encountered before. Another pivotal experience was the \"birth of the diamond soul.\" Eleven years prior, I had an experience of my life as a completed whole, from start to finish, but in my fortieth session, I began to sense the integration of all my former lives. It was as if all my previous incarnations were winding together, like a string of white light around a kite spool. When this collective memory hit a critical mass, it exploded, fusing all those individual lives into one, and my consciousness soared beyond any sense of individual existence. I experienced what I call diamond luminosity—my heart ruptured, and my awareness expanded dramatically. This was my first taste of the state where I believe reincarnation is taking us.",

And you emphasized again that awakenings aren’t the end point; beyond them is integration—allowing the realization to incarnate through us. You pointed to diamond vision and its resonance with Tibetan Buddhism. Interestingly, Tibetan Buddhism speaks of a further stage—pure perception—where one’s perception is transformed so that this world is seen not as mundane materiality but as an expression of that diamond illumination, a pure land optimized for awakening. Your description of both the illumination and its effects mirrors what’s recognized and highly valued in certain traditions.",

The Hindu word for enlightenment was moksha—escape—escaping time and space. I think those cosmologies got half the message, but lost half the message. They represent incomplete visions of history because they leave unanswered the question: What is the purpose of time and space? What is the purpose of this magnificent universe? It’s been called a veil of suffering, a place to get out of as quickly as we can to return to divine bliss. I understand that, given the historical period when we began to have experiential access to deep divine truths.
