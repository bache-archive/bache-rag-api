Based on the archived talks, here are the most relevant passages: ome abiding in any serious sense. I always want to qualify insights that emerge in psychedelic work.
Tasshin Fogleman:
Yes, and certainly for myself, this comes from a place of deep respect. Buddhism is like my home in a certain way, and I appreciate your clarifications. You spoke earlier about your spiritual practice and the different traditions you’ve been exposed to. It seems like you found a home in Vajrayana Buddhism—is that right?

Chris Bache:
It is, and it’s a kind of modified… (2022-08-30, Psychedelics and Cosmological Exploration with Chris Bache – Reach Truth Podcast) meditation and Vajrayana in augmenting, supporting, enhancing, stabilizing what you’ve gone through?

One gift of my psychedelic experiences was a deepened appreciation for the power and effectiveness of classic contemplative practices, including Vajrayana. By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that… (2022-02-17, Exploring LSD as a Practice (Edge of Mind Podcast – Part 1), [01:58:42–01:59:13](https://youtu.be/eV86_iSTEbU?t=7122)) essions I was given many practices—told, “Do this, do that”—and I took those into my daily practice.

I’d always been a meditator, but I began a more formal relationship with Vajrayana teachers and practice. This helped where I was working—very pure, intense states of awareness, Diamond Luminosity. It was increasingly difficult for my subtle energy system to sustain encounters with… (2023-01-06, LSD and the Mind of the Universe – S2S Podcast, [00:54:17–00:54:44](https://youtu.be/Kh5aqAuDBIM?t=3256)) rrelate with what’s described in the Tantras and in the Vadnais Sutras of the Dharmakaya. Beautiful.
Emmy Vadnais:
A question from Megan Salar: you’ve mentioned the importance of meditation and work outside the psychedelic sessions. What does your daily practice look like, or what would you recommend?

Chris Bache:
The longer I worked with psychedelics, the more I appreciated the importance of a daily spiritual practice. Conscientious psychedelic work opens your system to a vast field of… (2025-05-18, Diamond Luminosity (live stream)) Fogleman:
What do you think it was about Vajrayana Buddhism that attracted you and felt like a home?
Chris Bache:
It was my first wife, Carol—my sitter in my sessions and a clinical psychologist—who really brought me into Vajrayana. I was more interested in the Zen tradition. I wasn’t interested in all the bells, candles, incense, and fanfare that comes with Vajrayana. But she went there, and I followed her. Through her, I met teachers gathering at the Tara Mandala Buddhist retreat center—Lama… (2022-08-30, Psychedelics and Cosmological Exploration with Chris Bache – Reach Truth Podcast, [00:55:37–00:56:04](https://youtu.be/FEQ8ony19sk?t=3337))
