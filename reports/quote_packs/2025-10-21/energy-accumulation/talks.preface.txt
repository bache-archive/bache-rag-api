Based on the archived talks, here are the most relevant passages: 50 sessions in than in the first few. Third, the quality of the massive amounts of energy involved.
Working in serial sessions—on average about five a year—I built energetic momentum. I worked four years, stopped six, then worked ten more, averaging five a year. Systematic work takes your body and mind into those states repeatedly; like an athlete in training, you build energy that carries you to new performance levels.
