Over multiple sessions, there’s an accumulation of energy in your being. My system was storing energy session after session, even when months apart, building a massive momentum that would focus and lead to a breakthrough into a new level of consciousness. Those breakthroughs were paid for not simply by hours of intense work but sometimes by years of work. To get back into some of the territory I explored—the diamond luminosity—it would take years of conscientious work to rebuild that energetic momentum.",

Nothing seems to happen, then a few bubbles, then, at boiling point, it erupts into steam. Simple metaphor, but true throughout nature. Humanity is reaching that period. Scientists point to similar thresholds. The ocean, for example, has been capturing huge amounts of CO2—sinking it to the deep—but it’s slowly building up. At some point the ocean can no longer capture more; its ability weakens, and the CO2 we create suddenly explodes into the atmosphere. It looks like we’ve been in a hiatus, and we have, because there’s an illusion we’ve been okay—until everything speeds up much more quickly than most could conceive. Some scientists see it—especially those who work across multiple fields, systems theorists who understand interconnectivity. And mystics like us. Many are predicting very quick change that can be destabilizing for the planet.",

We, as individual egos, are born over and over again in roughly hundred-year cycles. Underneath those cycles there’s a learning taking place, a developmental process we usually refer to as the soul. The individual incarnates, but the soul is growing, becoming more, suffusing our lives. The same thing happens collectively: every generation, billions of people are born, but there’s a learning gathering underneath them, collecting in deep, archetypal structures.

The principle of accumulation is fundamental to understanding what’s happening in creation. The universe is accumulating—it’s learning. It’s a self-learning system. We are constantly learning; we can’t help but learn. Even if we do a mediocre job in a lifetime, we’re still learning. As we learn, we activate capacities. In one sense, I think we’re learning to be geniuses in every area of life: a genius at chess, a genius at relationships—genius in all the different areas. Each lifetime is a petal in a flower; the soul is the flower. I sometimes meditate on a flower and imagine each hundred-year lifetime as a pistil, a stamen, a petal in this magnificent flower. To be a genius at life—to be completely unfolded and take advantage of the opportunity we’ve been given to grow and become more than we’ve been.",

This is important: as you go deeper into the universe, every deeper level of reality functions at a higher level of energy. This is recognized in the deep mystical traditions. A deeper level of consciousness is a higher level of energy, and if you are going to have stable experience there, you must stabilize your consciousness at that higher energy. Mountain climbers adapt to less oxygen as they ascend; likewise, in deep non-ordinary states you must accommodate greater and greater energy, learning to manage it.

This comes at the very end of \"The Living Classroom.\" The book was published in 2008, written in 2006–2007, and I stopped the heavy-duty psychedelic work in '99. Over time, this energetic resonance calmed down; it didn't go away entirely, but instead of being like a lightning rod, where things happened around me without my effort, I had to cooperate with it—I had to let it happen. Not that I could control it, but there was a sense that it was subtler. That teaches us something about the etheric level: the practice empowers the system, you open up, you bring in heavy-duty energy, you move from 110 volts to 240 volts—naturally, you activate these inherent circuits. But then if things calm down, it’s not like the circuits go away—the network is there, but there’s less energy driving it. There's wisdom in the pace of evolution. There is a certain—not a risk, exactly, but if you drive the system hard, things happen; then you calm down and things settle. So I don’t have that transparency today that I did at the peak described in \"The Living Classroom.\" Now it’s much subtler than it was then.",

These practices build the capacity to enter very profound states of consciousness. If you enter these deeper states rapidly—as can happen with psychedelics—very powerful purification processes are triggered: physical, emotional, and mental detoxification.

In this time of accelerated, intensified individual suffering, it’s not just our individual psyches being activated, but all the suffering of humanity gathering at a centralized level—as a morphogenic field, as Sheldrake has helped us understand. The scenario that unfolded was that the collective psyche will move into such a highly energized state that it will begin to operate as a non-linear, far-from-equilibrium system. We know something about how physical systems operate in non-linear conditions: they are capable of accelerated change; small perturbations produce expanded outcomes; creativity emerges from within the system in unprecedented ways; hydrogen and oxygen combine to produce water.

Students knew something unusual was happening. I couldn’t exactly explain it, but we all knew. Some took my courses partly for the intellectual content and partly to be in the energy of the room.\n\nIt wasn’t just resonance between my energy and theirs; there was a second phenomenon I discuss in The Living Classroom: group fields. Think of Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic fields, but smaller and more specific. I found psychic fields growing around my courses, getting stronger year by year. Hundreds of students learning over many years created a field that impacted, accelerated, and deepened the learning of subsequent students. Multiple factors were at play.",

We generate energy by making choices, and the universe responds to this energy.” That’s what you were describing with the lake. “We are always creating our own experience,” and, “We control the flow of energy out from and back into our lives. What comes to us from without originates from within. The more one moves toward one’s center and engages the deeper levels of one’s conditioning, the more one becomes conscious of being the source of one’s experience.” I suppose that insight continues to evolve with you. It’s a powerful synthesis of the human journey whether you do psychedelics or not, because it’s true in day-to-day consciousness. You don’t need an altered state to realize you’re the catalyst of what the universe brings to you.",

I stopped for two reasons. I stopped first because my physical system—my subtle energy system, my prana or qi—was running so hot after all these years of practice that it was producing certain physical symptoms that left me continually uncomfortable. I describe these in the book, but basically I understood enough about chronic energy and Ayurvedic medicine to understand what was happening, and I was just running too much energy. But that's not the major reason I stopped. The major reason I stopped was heartache. It was getting increasingly difficult to come back from the deep states of ecstatic transcendence—immersion in the divine fabric—back into my time-space reality.",

The universe carries you into deeper levels of consciousness.

The individual mind is situated within a class mind, situated within a course mind. Once you see it, you begin to recognize it everywhere. If there is a hyperobject, it’s simply the connective tissue of mind. We are always inherently connected; we can become conscious of that and responsible to it in whatever we’re doing.\n\nAndrew Holecek:\nAnd again, it’s back to making unconscious processes conscious.

But that's not what I saw. As suffering increases, the entire psychic field of humanity—the collective unconscious—will be increasingly pressurized, shoved into what physicists call nonlinear or far-from-equilibrium conditions. In far-from-equilibrium conditions, individual perturbations produce large outcomes. Which means that as we enter deeper into our crisis of history, individuals can have a larger and larger impact on the outcome—on how this crisis will manifest.
